            Greetings! If you've stumbled across, let me give you a brief of what <span>Yogita Damodaran</span> holds within.
            This is <b>Yogita Damodaran</b> and a little something about me is the fact that <span>I'm not as predictable as my name sounds.</span>
            Hailing from northern and southern parts of the country, I hold great value of cultures, styles and rituals.
            Cherry on the cake is my <strong>fluency in 5 languages</strong> that open doors for me to interact and mingle with various people, making me approachable, 
            not to forget the base of this cake being my bubbly personality! Talking to people, listening to them, and majorly being there as an emotionally humble individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            I live by 3 principles and they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Love everyone</span></li>
            <li><span>Trust a handful</span></li>
            <li><span>Be truthful to oneself</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p>
            This gives a brief insight into my overall personality, stepping towards academics, bubbling with curiosity and standing still with dedication! 
            <span>I enjoy learning!</span> My schooling is driven by one of the most reputed regimental defence schools in the country, 
            <b>Kendriya Vidyalaya DRDO, Bengaluru.</b> Being competitive has always been my edge, holding a <b>scholarship</b> in 10th grade 
            for being amongst the <strong>top 1.5% rankers</strong> in KVS India to being a gold medalist for 4 years in the olympiads organised 
            by SOF in the fields of International Mathematics Olympiad and National Science Olympiad. 
            <span>I have always had the hunger to learn and achieve more while staying grounded and connected to my principles.</span> 
            Further, I made my way into <b>Vellore Institute of Technology</b> pursuing <b>Computer Science</b> with specialisation in Bioinformatics.

            Peeping into my co-curricular basket, holding a leadership position since elementary school led me to being elected as the 
            <b>Student President</b> in my senior year. This indeed rooted empathy and people management skills in me. 
            Besides this, I have my hands on speaking arts wherein <span>I've been a state and regional level poet</span> representing institutions at various stages. 
            Currently, I am preparing to represent <b>VIT Vellore</b> in <span>IIT Bombay's prestigious fest <b>MOOD INDIGO!</b></span>
